<p>Cool! You've got your endpoint ready to go. Now you just need to go to your Braintree control panel and set up your webhooks to point at this url:</p>
<div class="well"> https://webhooket.herokuapp.com{{ request.path }} </div>
<p>Once you get your webhook settings just the way you like them in the control panel,
head over to <a href="{{url_for('configs_show', webhook_config_id=webhook.webhook_config_id)}}">the details page for this webhook</a> to see what activity you've got!</p>
